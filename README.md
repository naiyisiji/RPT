Along with the survey, a problem description will also send to Interviewee as follow:

Hello, we invite you to participate in a survey on safe driving behavior. Please click the first link and fill in your age, driving experience, gender, and educational level. After completing and submitting this form, please click the second link to answer our questions related to safe driving.

The second link is a survey questionnaire about safe driving. After clicking the second link, click the "white checkmark on a blue background" on the redirected page to access the questionnaire. This survey contains 60 questions, grouped into pairs. Each group has two questions: one is to assess the risk level of the presented scenario, and the other is to determine the appropriate response strategy as a driver in that scenario.

Risk level refers to the likelihood of an accident occurring. The risk levels range from high to low with options: 90%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, and 0%. The "90%" option corresponds to "the probability of danger in this scenario is greater than 80%," while "0%" means "the scenario is almost free of danger." Before each scenario, the vehicle is assumed to be in a safe driving state.

The response strategy involves selecting the action you, as the driver, should take in the depicted scenario. The available options are: accelerate in a straight line, decelerate in a straight line, turn left at the current speed, turn right at the current speed, and maintain the current speed and direction.

After selecting an option for each question, click the "checkmark" at the bottom of the screen to proceed to the next question.
